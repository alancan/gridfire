* GridFire

GridFire is a raster-based fire spread and severity model that may be
used for both static and dynamic calculations of various standard fire
behavior metrics across a landscape. For inputs, it requires a stack
of co-registered raster maps for your area of interest as well as a
set of scalar values which may be input via a configuration file.
These inputs are listed in the following table:

|---------------------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Value                     | Units                               | Type                               |

| canopy-cover-matrix       | 0-100                               | core.matrix 2D double array        |

** Static Calculations

In this mode, GridFire can be used to calculate full coverage maps of
the following fire behavior metrics given a fixed set of weather
conditions:

|-------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------------|
| Value                   | Units                    | Type                        |
|-------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------------|
| max-rate-of-spread      | feet/min                 | core.matrix 2D double array |
| max-direction-of-spread | feet/min                 | core.matrix 2D double array |
| fire-type               | category 0-3 (see below) | core.matrix 2D double array |
| flame-length            | feet                     | core.matrix 2D double array |
| fire-line-intensity     | Btu/ft/s                 | core.matrix 2D double array |
| wind-adjustment-factor  | percentage (0-1)         | core.matrix 2D double array |
|-------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------------------|

The Fire Type categories are as follows:

0. Non-burnable
1. Surface Fire
2. Passive Crown Fire
3. Active Crown Fire

** Dynamic Simulation

In this mode, GridFire may be asked to simulate individual ignition
events and calculate their size and severity after a fixed amount of
time (e.g., a 1 hour fire event). These simulation outputs are listed
in the following table.

|----------------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------|
| Value                      | Units                                  | Type                        |
|----------------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------|
| global-clock               | minutes                                | double                      |
| initial-ignition-site      | point represented as [row col]         | vector                      |
| ignited-cells              | set of points represented as [row col] | set                         |
| fire-spread-matrix         | percent heated (0-1)                   | core.matrix 2D double array |
| flame-length-matrix        | feet                                   | core.matrix 2D double array |
| fire-line-intensity-matrix | Btu/ft/s                               | core.matrix 2D double array |

* Usage

GridFire has been coded as a literate program
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) using Emacs'
org-mode (http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/). Full
documentation of the current system can always be found in
*org/GridFire.org* and *org/GridFire.pdf* in this repository.
